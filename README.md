# Parallel processing in NodeJS

Creating random id with nodejs parallel processing

## prerequisites

It's dependency free and you just need to have NodeJS installed on your machine

## About program

I was practicing parallel programming and concurrency in NodeJS and this one came to my mind.

### how to run project

clone:

`https://github.com/fractalliter/nodejs-parallel.git`

go to project folder:

`cd nodejs-parallel/`

run npm:

`npm start`

or:

`node index.js`

then you would have a uuids.txt file with content similar to this one:
